# XAI-bandselection
Download Pavia University data from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes to root

run: python bandselection.py,  or python bandselection.pyc

We have updated the bandselection.py, researchers can set arbitrary T parameter, arbitrary C parameter, and the number of the selected bands(n_nands).

In the future, we will open the source code until the project is finished.
